ToolDaemon
==========

Mac OS Classic shareware made open source

ToolDaemon makes your (classic) MacOS computer remotely accessible to authorized users, from any platform, through any Telnet client.

Indeed, your (classic) MacOS computer becomes a true multi-threaded, multi-user environment, where logged users can simultaneously take *any* action on the system.

To achieve this, ToolDaemon needs some help from ToolServer, a very nice program from Apple Computer, Inc.
